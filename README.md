this is the hugo project I use to produce my neocities site ^_^

I'd prefer if you didnt just copy this in its entirety, but feel free to take
whatever you want from it for your own use.

It doesn't use a theme because for one-off sites like this I think its overkill
to have the theme in a separate project, so I just used the layouts folder of
the site
